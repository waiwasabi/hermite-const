## Description

This project implements a heuristic search on the $\mathfrak{U}(p)$ space of lattices, as described in Hlawka et al. [[1]](#1), to find dense lattice packings of equal hyperspheres.

## Getting Started

The following instructions describe the basic steps required to download the project and its dependencies on a Unix machine.

### Prerequisites

Install Victor Shoup's [NTL](https://libntl.org/) library. The project is known to work with `ntl-11.5.1`, the latest version as of July 2024.

A quick-start overview of the installation process is provided below. Detailed installation options can be found in the full documentation [here](https://libntl.org/doc/tour-unix.html). 

Begin by downloading `ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz` from the official website. To install a different version, replace `11.5.1` with the desired version number.

```
% wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
% gunzip ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
% tar xf ntl-11.5.1.tar
```

Navigate to the `src` folder of the directory that was just extracted:
```
% cd ntl-11.5.1/src
```

The following commands will build, test, and install `ntl-11.5.1` in `/usr/local`. 
```
% ./configure
% make
% make check
% sudo make install
```

**NOTE:** if superuser privileges are not available, it is possible to install NTL in `$HOME` by specifying a prefix in the configuration script.  The following commands will install the library in `$HOME/ntl` instead.

```
% ./configure PREFIX=$HOME/ntl
% make
% make check
% make install
```


### Installing 

Simply clone the repository, i.e.

```
git clone https://github.com/waiwasabi/sphere-packing.git
```

This will copy the project to `sphere-packing`.

### Building the Project

The provided `Makefile` will generate an executable `main` from the contents of `main.cpp`. 

```
% make
```

**NOTE:** if NTL was installed in the `$HOME` directory, it it necessary to specify the location of the library to the compiler, i.e. adding `-I<path-to-ntl>` as a compiler flag.


Remove the binaries generated by `make` like so:
```
% make clean
```
